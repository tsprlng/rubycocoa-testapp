RubyCocoa TestApp
=================

This is a very simple example of how to successfully write an OS X application that displays a window and correct menu bar, in [RubyCocoa](https://rubycocoa.github.io/).

It does not require a .nib file or any of that other nonsense.

What is really nice about this is:

1. You get to use Ruby.
2. You get to not install XCode.

RubyCocoa, by the way, is only about 6MB in size. Releases are at https://github.com/rubycocoa/rubycocoa/releases.

It's basically just a translation/enhancement of a blog post by Matt Gallagher entitled ['Minimalist Cocoa programming'](http://www.cocoawithlove.com/2010/09/minimalist-cocoa-programming.html). Thank you, Matt.
